# File preparation
MatWAND accepts files .mat or binary files. The files can be separated by MatWAND or manually by the user.

## Naming
- MatWAND requires the files to contain a unique identifier between underscores.
- This is essential for matching the files based on animal or subject. 
- For example, in **animal1\_101_base.mat** where the identified is ***101***.


### 1) MatWAND separation
-Data files that need to be separated by MatWAND should only have an underscore before
- for example files can be named #35hpc_wt

### 1) User separation
