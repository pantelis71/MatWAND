## MatWAND data processing:


Here follows a step by step tutorial on how to use MatWAND to analyze binary files from labchart.

1) Load Folder Directory.

2) Convert voltage traces to power spectral density (PSD) using the [fft transform](https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/power-spectral-density-estimates-using-fft.html) and store to "raw_psd" folder.

+ Automatic separation of .mat files based on comment times.

3) Pre-process the analyzed PSD data  and store to "processed_psd" folder.

4) Plot data from the "processed_psd" folder.
